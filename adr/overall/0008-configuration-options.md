# Configuration Options for Crypto Broker Server

## Context and Problem Statement

The `crypto-broker-server` currently discovers profiles via an environment variable `CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_DIR` that points to a directory which acts as safe root directory that contains `Profiles.yaml` (please see [os.Root](https://pkg.go.dev/os@go1.25.1#Root), [Travelsal-resistant file APIs](https://go.dev/blog/osroot)). At startup, the server validates that the provided path is absolute and readable and then reads a predefined profiles file (`Profiles.yaml`) from this directory.

We plan to improve configurability for different deployment environments (local development, Cloud Foundry sidecar, Kubernetes with ConfigMaps/Secrets) and offer a clear precedence model. We also want to assess options for immutable builds, dynamic reloading, and secure handling of configuration.

Problem question: What configuration sources and precedence should the server support to balance security, portability, and simplicity?

## Decision Drivers

* Security (handle secrets safely) and least-privilege access (possibly avoid overexposing filesystem)
* Operational ergonomics across K8s, Cloud Foundry, and VMs
* No requirement to preserve backward compatibility with `CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_DIR`
* Clear, deterministic precedence of multiple configuration sources
* Observability of which source is used, with explicit error messages and validation
* Simplicity of implementation and low maintenance overhead

## Considered Options

* Keep current model: environment variable pointing to a directory (`CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_DIR`) containing `Profiles.yaml`
* Environment variable pointing directly at a profile file (e.g., `CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_FILE`)
* Environment variable carrying the full YAML content inline (e.g., `CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_YAML`)
* Command-line flags (e.g., `--profiles-dir`, `--profiles-file`, `--profiles-yaml`)
* Config file with OS/XDG search order of conventional locations as a fallback
* Embedded defaults using `go:embed` for non-production convenience
* Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry alignment: ConfigMap/Secret mounts or env injection

### Additional aspects worth consideration

* Build-time injection via `-ldflags` into exported variables (immutable-by-build)
* Dynamic reload (e.g., SIGHUP)

## Decision Outcome

TBD

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Keep current: `CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_DIR` only

#### Good, because
* Simple and already implemented, least code change.
* Security boundaries are clear (read-only directory, absolute path).
#### Neutral, because
* Works well with file mounts in containers.
#### Bad, because
* Inflexible in environments where direct file mounts are inconvenient.
* No inline/env or CLI options for quick testing.

### Env var pointing to a file: `CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_FILE`

#### Good, because
* Directly supports K8s/CF mounts to a single file; easy to audit permissions.
#### Neutral, because
* Similar security model to directory but narrower scope.
#### Bad, because
* Still requires a file to exist; not ideal for pure-env deployments.

### Env var with inline YAML: `CRYPTO_BROKER_PROFILES_YAML`

#### Good, because
* No filesystem dependency; fits CF manifests and secrets-in-env patterns.
#### Neutral, because
* Convenient for small configs only.
#### Bad, because
* Risk of logs/inspection leaking configuration from environment.
* Harder to manage large multi-line YAML and rotation.

### Build-time injection via `-ldflags`

#### Good, because
* Immutable binaries with embedded defaults; reproducible behavior.
#### Bad, because
* Rebuild required for config changes; not flexible for ops.

### Command-line flags

#### Good, because
* Local dev and debugging ergonomics; explicit over implicit.
#### Neutral, because
* Common practice for Go services.
#### Bad, because
* Another surface to document and test.

### Config file + XDG/OS default search

#### Good, because
* Sensible defaults for bare-metal environments.
#### Neutral, because
* Rarely used in containerized production.
#### Bad, because
* Might surprise users if undocumented; must be low precedence.

### Embedded defaults (`go:embed`) behind opt-in

#### Good, because
* Zero-setup for demos and quickstarts.
#### Bad, because
* Risky if accidentally enabled in prod; must require explicit flag or similar mechanism.

Please see [embed](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) for more info.

### Dynamic reload (SIGHUP/inotify)

SIGHUP is one of the POSIX signals (short for Signal Hang Up) sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed or disconnected.
Today, it’s commonly used to tell daemons or background services to reload their configuration files without restarting.

#### Good, because
* Enables seamless rotation without restarts.
#### Neutral, because
* Only for advanced operators.
#### Bad, because
* Complexity and potential for partial failure; requires rollback logic and strong validation.
